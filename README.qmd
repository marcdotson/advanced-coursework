## Description

This project investigates the factors that lead to student involvement in advanced educational programs and the outcomes associated with such participation. The primary objectives are to identify the demographic, socioeconomic, and institutional variables that serve as precursors to enrollment in these programs and to analyze the impact that participation has on studentsâ€™ academic and career trajectories. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of student data from middle school through high school graduation, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform district policy and program development.
